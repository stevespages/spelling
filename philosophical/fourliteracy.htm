<h2>WHAT DO OTHER PEOPLE DO? (Four Literacy Programmes)</h2>


<p>When faced with a problem you haven't yet been able to solve, it's a good idea to ask what other people do.   Here is a brief account of four approaches to teaching people to read and write.   They come from different situations and are themselves different from one another, but they also have important features in common.   They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Japanese Elementary Education 

<li>Reading Recovery in New Zealand 

<li>The British Army's School of Preliminary Education 

<li>The Adult Literacy Scheme in Oxfordshire.
</ul>

<h3>LEARNING TO WRITE IN JAPAN: </h3>

<p>I decided to study what the Japanese did because I was constantly being told that the reason there is such difficulty in Britain with mastering our spelling is that our writing system is so diabolically anarchic and illogical.   Each time someone told me that my thoughts flew to Japan.  I did not know much about its writing system but I thought it must be at least as complicated as ours and I understood that literacy rates are high in Japan, most people are educated at least to A Level standard and a huge proportion of them go on to university.   All these well-educated and well-trained people must have begun by mastering the writing system.   I asked myself whether it was as difficult as I thought and, if so, how so many Japanese people manage to learn it.   I found the answers fascinating and illuminating.</p>

<p><i>One reason why their written language is so difficult is that they choose to make it so.    It is nonetheless remarkable, not only that a system of such complexity can be mastered by so large a population, but also that it can serve as the basis of one of the world's most technologically advanced cultures.</i></p>

<p>There are several formidable things about Japanese writing.   The first is that it uses Chinese characters which are well suited to Chinese, but not at all to Japanese, an entirely different sort of language.   They had no writing at all until comparatively late in their history and they acquired the Chinese script from the Koreans who had already adopted it for themselves.   They call it "kanji" and, as in Chinese, it represents the meanings of words but not their sounds.   Unfortunately kanji can't cover grammatical words because Chinese doesn't have these (it has been described as being like "sending a telegram" - "coming Sunday car" for "I shall be arriving by car on Sunday"), but Japanese has plenty of them, pronouns, prepositions, modal verbs and so on.   There are also, as with every language, imported foreign words, so they have added "kana", which comes in two forms one for the grammatical words and another for the foreign ones.   Kana represents sounds but not in the way our alphabet does;  it represents whole syllables.   It has been called, with justice,</p>

<blockquote><p>a quite astonishingly complicated method of making language visible   (Sampson 1984)</p></blockquote>

<!-- Sampson 1984 should not be part of the quote. How to include it properly? -->

<p>So the Japanese learner has to master three different systems as well as the rules for when and how each of them is to be applied.   It is stated above that they deliberately made it complicated (probably like the famous "tea ceremony"), the suggestion being that at the time they had a large leisured, but influential, class for whose idle hands the devil might easily find work to do.   This seems quite likely, but, in fact, there was no other script available to them then so the only alternative would have been to devise one of their own.</p>

<p>In any case, no-one has ever suggested that it is simple or easy to learn, so we surely have to admit that almost every Japanese schoolchild demonstrates a remarkable ability to learn and persevere in the course of becoming literate.   How is this achieved?</p>

<p>Although they have a shorter school day in Japan than in Britain or America, the school year is longer, so that Japanese children get about 20% more hours of instruction.   The study of the Japanese language dominates the curriculum and the lessons appear on the timetable not as "Japanese" but as "the National Language".   There has traditionally been a conscious and sustained pride in "Japaneseness", of which children are continually reminded and, of course, pride in the language is a significant part of this.   Education is greatly respected, as are teachers.    They are the most highly paid of all government employees, at least on entry to the profession, and mothers are expected to back up their efforts by providing every kind of possible support for their children's learning at home.</p>  

<p>On the other hand expenditure on schools is not high in comparison with other countries, the buildings and classrooms are not of a high standard, classes are huge, noisy and chaotic and nobody seems to mind.   If they failed to learn we would probably point to these conditions as being part, at least, of the problem.</p>

<p>Attitudes, however, are very different.   In Japan there is no talk of levels of ability or IQ.   People don't wonder about how clever you are or whether you will be able to learn.   If you haven't learned something yet then you are exhorted to persevere, but so you are if you have succeeded;  you then must go on and learn the next bit.   You do have to work extremely hard, but everyone has to and no excuses, as of poverty, disability or lack of inborn talent are offered or accepted.   So there is little fear of failure, no idea that this learning might be beyond some people and no competition between individuals.   Social cohesiveness is much prized and everyone is encouraged to co-operate and strive for the glory of the group as a whole.   In fact, as another researcher tells us:</p>

<blockquote><p>The important point is that there is in Japan no conflict between the goals of self-fulfilment and the goals of social integration.</p></blockquote>
 
<p>Fierce competition does indeed come into children's lives with "examination hell", but that happens later, in secondary school, and does not affect the early learning of the written language. </p>


<h3>READING RECOVERY IN NEW ZEALAND:</h3>

<p>The New Zealand Reading Recovery programme claims that since its inception:</p>

<blockquote><p>.... very rarely has the percentage of children referred to specialists reached the 1% level.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words 99% of New Zealand children go through their educational careers without being hampered by the inability to read and write well enough to go on studying with their classmates.   If children have started to struggle in their early years their teachers have become aware of it, but they themselves have not, because they have been helped to "recover" at the age of six before they have noticed any problem.   That tiny percentage who still fail and need specialists are a percentage of the whole year-group, including all the sick, disadvantaged and disabled children, not just those considered "normal".</p>

<p>The value of the comparison here is, of course, that New Zealand has so much in common with Britain, the language obviously but also history and culture.   Like us, the country has quite large minorities of different ethnic origin from that of the majority and whose mother-tongues are not English.   There is a much smaller range of differences in these minorities than exists here, but the similarities are strong enough to make New Zealand well worth studying.   They have exported Reading Recovery to parts of Australia and some states in America, where it is also claimed to be successful.   There have been some attempts to implement it in Britain and I hoped it would really take off, but so far it hasn't.</p>

<p>Reading Recovery is the brainchild of Mari Clay and sprang from her long and meticulous observations of a hundred children beginning to learn to read and write in their first year in school.   She is firm about its exact nature, emphasising that it is not a theory or a method of teaching but a programme which draws on any methods and theories that are useful.   In her research, she says:</p>

<blockquote><p>I tried to record, by objecive procedures and in minute detail, the observable reading "behaviour"   Behaviour is the key word.   The records described what the children did and what they said, with no prior assumptions as to how or why they did these things. </p></blockquote>

<p>She concluded:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whatever the origins of reading difficulties they have a large learned component.   They limit achievement in school learning.   They get worse if untreated and many pupils get further behind their classmates over time even when they receive available treatments.</p></blockquote>

<p>She lists no fewer than thirteen different ways in which some of the hundred children whom she studied managed to get into a muddle with their early reading and writing and concludes that:</p>

<blockquote><p>A flexible programme which respects individuality at first, gradually brings children to the point where group instruction can be provided for those with common learning needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So there is now in New Zealand a "corps elite" of specially trained teachers who deliver the Reading Recovery programme.   They are distributed around the primary schools and work alongside the other teachers in the schools.    The children start school on the day after their fifth birthday and the programme starts a year later when they are six.   The reasoning behind the timing is that in their first year the children are likely to be shy, homesick, overexcited, young for their age and so on, and it is better to wait until they have had time to settle down thoroughly before assessing them.   There are great advantages in the staggered entry to school followed by the staggered start of the programme.  It makes it manageable for the teachers to have the children coming into the programme gradually and avoids the problems faced in British Reception classes where everybody may well be five but some are only just five and others nearly six, which can mean an enormous discrepancy at that time of rapid growth and learning, in their maturity, experiences, achievements so far and any number of factors which have a big influence on their learning.</p>

<p>All the New Zealand children go regularly to a teacher to do a bit of individual reading and writing, so that when they start on the programme they notice no difference.   This time the teacher, armed with a huge list derived from Clays's exhaustive research, is finding out exactly what they can and can't do, what they do and don't understand so far and what their attitudes are towards the written language in general.   There is a lot to check.   It starts with which way up to hold the book - not everyone of six is sure about that!   Do they hold the pencil correctly (not a quibble, it does really save trouble later)?   Then, the alphabet has 26 letters and for each of these one needs to know its name, its sound, its place in the alphabet and how to write it in both lower- and upper-case form.   As well as the letters there are spaces, the distinction between letters, words and sentences, punctuation and spelling.   Most children learn these haphazardly and probably without noticing the process, and most manage it successfully, but if they don't there is going to be trouble.</p>

<p>This sounds like a terrible gradgrind, and it is a bit, but only for the teacher.   The child is just reading to the teacher and writing little stories as usual, but all the time the teacher is quietly ticking off all those items of knowledge  and skill and seeing where the gaps in knowledge and skill are for that particular child.   Once this exhaustive, but surreptitious, testing has been completed those children, the majority, who have "passed" just go on with the usual school curriculum with the rest of their class.   They still go off for individual sessions with a teacher but for shorter periods and less frequently.   Those who have been assigned to the programme continue to work individually with the specialist teacher to fill these gaps and to increase their confidence and experience of the written language until they, too, have reached the point where they no longer need this extra help and can continue to make normal progress without it.   Both the testing and the tuition must be done individually because, as Mari Clay found, each child has different gaps, so that working in groups, even small ones, would be much too slow to enable children to "catch up";  there is no time to wait while other pupils sort out their problems.</p>   

<p>They remain in the programme for a minimum of twelve, and a maximum of twenty, weeks, leaving it when they have reached the required standard.   Anyone still in difficulties after that is deemed to have a particular need and becomes one of the 1% or less who are referred to psychologists, doctors or other professionals.   Because the numbers are so small they can receive attention at once and will probably get opportunities unheard-of in Britain to make some sort of progress.   Of course such children, selected after such a rigorous screening process are likely to have extremely deep-seated and intractable problems and may not be recoverable, but at least they are not competing for help with large numbers of others who have just got into tiny muddles which have then loomed large and become real handicaps.</p>

<p>It sounds wonderful and it is wonderful, so why on earth don't we do it here?   Because it is undoubtedly and inevitably expensive.   The Reading Recovery teachers have to be carefully selected and very thoroughly trained.     They must be skilful because their task is to "accelerate" children, who are already going more slowly than their classmates, so that they are now going even faster than them, as they must if they are to catch up and continue alongside them.   It is quite a formidable task.   It means that a Primary school in New Zealand has a very high ratio of staff to pupils and that some of these are highly paid by educational standards.   Dame Mari Clay (as she deservedly became) had a will of iron and a formidable personality and a big part of her triumph was that she persuaded the Government adopt her programme.   Other authorities have seen the point and have their own Reading Recovery programmes, a few even in Britain, but, although its value is acknowledged in educational circles, it has not been generally adopted here because of the expense.</p>

<p>In the long run, of course, it is cheap and excellent value for money.   Although the term Special Educational Needs includes disabilities of all kinds, its clientele is mostly composed of children with reading and writing problems.   Few of them make much progress, fewer still recover completely and, as they grow up through school, they often create trouble or drop out and play truant.   Later they may well adopt anti-social, even criminal, behaviour and they are more likely than most to be unemployed or badly paid so that they need benefits.   It is impossible to calculate what all this adds up to, but it must be an enormous expense compared with the extra cost to schools of a Reading Recovery Programme.</p>


<h3>PRELIMINARY EDUCATION IN THE BRITISH ARMY:</h3>

<ul>
<li><i>1. The aim of the School of Preliminary Education will be to provide a ten-and-a-half week course for those soldiers who require tuition to raise them to the educational standard necessary to enable them to benefit fully from normal training and to fit them to carry out the duties of their Arms or Corps.</i>

<li><i>2. By improvement in their skills in reading, writing and number, they will be  
     encouraged and given the opportunity to reach the highest standards of which they 
     are capable as trained soldiers, tradesmen and  potential leaders.</i>

<li>(Charter of the Army School of Preliminary Education)
</ul>


<p>The Army's School of Preliminary Education's heyday came during the Second World War and afterwards during the period of National Service.   The Army had found that many new recruits were impossible to train because they were deficient in reading, writing and number.   It closed in 1981 because by that time National Service had been abolished, the Army had contracted and unemployment had set in, so that they could now choose to employ only people who were adequately literate and numerate for their purposes.</p>

<p>Soldiers were tested on entry and those found to be deficient in literacy and numeracy, but considered nevertheless to have the potential to succeed, were posted to the SPE.   At the end of the course they were tested again.</p>

<blockquote><p>The results ... show that on all tests highly significant gains were achieved by all groups ... taking the SPE course.   The course was, therefore, of significant value to the Army even if increased academic attainment is taken as the sole criterion of its success. </p></blockquote>

<p>They also stayed longer in the Army than other recruits, so that the course, although very expensive for the Army in itself, was ultimately excellent value.</p>

<p>The men were taught in groups of 17.   An instructor was assigned to each group and had overall responsibility for them throughout the course.   He worked closely with them on their studies but also on their drill, physical training and football, which continued as part of normal Army training.   He accompanied them on expeditions.   Thus each man knew his fellow-students and his instructor extremely well by the end of the course and there was a high level of mutual support and trust within each group.</p>

<p>The instructors were Army Education Officers, but they were not specially selected and not literacy specialists, merely sent to the SPE in the ordinary course of postings.   However, the Commandant and the senior staff were experienced and the School had built up a great deal of expertise over the years, as well as a stock of materials and tried and tested teaching methods, so that there was plenty of professional support for the instructors.</p>

<p>A vital part of the course was regular, individual counselling for each student and 

<blockquote><p>free and creative activities designed to relieve inner tensions and conflicts</p></blockquote>

<p>and much of its success was attributed to</p>

<blockquote><p>improvements in those personal emotions and adjustments that have such close association with academic success or failure</p></blockquote>

<p>Even the hard-headed Army found it necessary to attend to the men's emotional needs, because its staff had found that they could not educate them successfully unless they did.</p>

<p>There were many tributes to its success, including this, couched in appropriate soldiers' language:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is the best thing that ever happened to me.   I'm in this lot because I need proper treatment.   ... I wrote my first letter.   I only been 'ere three and a half weeks and I went to ******* school for ten years!</blockquote></p>

<p>A full account of the School's work is found in Colin Stevenson's <i>Challenging Adult Literacy,</i> from which these extracts are taken.</p>


<h3>THE ADULT LITERACY SCHEME IN OXFORDSHIRE:</h3>

<p>In 1975 the Government and the BBC set up a national Adult Literacy Project, whereby local authorities would recruit and support volunteers from the general population to become tutors to other adults who had failed to learn to read and write well enough for their own purposes.   The BBC provided massive advertising for the project and was the main route by which students and voluntary tutors entered the scheme, fo which the Government provided a million pounds each year for the first three years.   This was intended as "pump-priming" to start the local authorities off in the hope that they would then take over the work and develop it themselves.   Many did, to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

<p>I was employed by Oxfordshire, first to research what was going on already in the County and then to set up and run the County's Literacy Scheme.</p>

<p>Tim Brighouse, Oxfordshire's Chief Education Officer pointed out that this was unique among educational initiatives in that the overwhelming majority of the work was done by volunteers;  the professional staff were a tiny minority of those involved.</p>

<p>The work was based on the Adult Education Centres and Further Education Colleges around the county.   Volunteers and students worked together in pairs but in most cases came into the local College or Centre to do so.   Thus each pair had autonomy about what  they worked on and how to tackle it, but they were able to call upon the advice and support of a professional tutor/organiser and had access to the learning resources provided by the authority.   Occasionally a pair would meet at the home of one of them, but everyone was encouraged to join the bigger group whenever possible.   This seemed to produce greater satisfaction than working in isolation and, on a mundane level, insurance companies refused to insure  the "outworkers".   This was mildly worrying for those in charge, but, in fact, no serious problems ever arose during the seven years I was there.</p>

<p>The whole operation seemed to run on goodwill and feelings of gratitude and respect from the students and sympathy and equal respect from the volunteers towards them.   It was inspiring work.   The volunteers often felt they learnt a great deal from it and of course the students did so too, but I think it is likely that those who learnt the most were myself and my professional colleagues who managed and supported the local groups.   The adult students were able to talk about what had happened to them and how they felt about studying now in a way that children seldom do.   Many of the tutors felt they would be able to do a better job if and when they returned to working in schools, as many of them eventually did.  It was during that time that I learned, through conversations with innumerable students, how much more serious was the inability to spell than the inability to read.   I learned a great deal else, above all what a totally unnecessary mess our literacy problem is.</p>

<p>Individual tuition was felt to be vital to the work.   The students arrived with widely differing levels of knowledge and skills and widely differing goals which they wanted to achieve.   They also seemed to have very different levels of ability to learn, though these were highly informal judgments made "on the hoof" as there was never any need for formal testing of any kind.   We couldn't have done that and did not wish to.  Working even with two students inevitably means that one will have wait for the other's difficulties to be sorted out from time to time and there is always a danger of discouraging comparisons being made or being thought to be being made.   The undivided attention of the tutor and the absolute confidence which grew up between tutor and student enabled the student to confide in him or her and to take risks with the work without being afraid of ridicule and it created, in most cases, the warm and sympathetic, but also business-like atmosphere which is most conducive to successful learning.</p>

<p>However it has to be acknowledged that, although there were some quite spectacular successes, it did not, in most cases, produce the sort of life-changing advances in literacy experienced by the Army scheme.   It was very poorly funded and few people got more than two hours' tuition a week.   At the start of the Project very few of the tutors, either voluntary or professional, had much relevant experience.   Those who had taught reading had taught it to young children;  those who had taught adults had not taught them to read.  
But most students continued to attend the lessons (it was very easy to drop out) and it was clear that they and their tutors mostly found them worthwhile.</p>

<p>As time went on it became clear that literacy was not the salient goal of most of the students.   What they had found intolerable was the feeling of failure they had experienced in school and this was often accompanied by a suspicion that they might be exceptionally stupid or even mentally deranged in some way.   "Will I be able to learn?" and "I think there's something wrong with my head" were anxieties which were frequently voiced.    It was usually easy to demonstrate that they could learn and that their heads were functioning as well as other people's.   You could show them how much they already knew and they could see for themselves what they could do one week which they could not do the week before.   They had become accustomed to living their lives without needing to read and write and, even when they got the opportunity to practise their new skills, they often reverted to their old habits.</p>

<p>What they gained from their tuition was, in fact, not so much literacy as self-confidence, freedom from those nagging fears of stupidity and mental disorder and, importantly, they had acquired strategies they could use if and when they did ever need to read or write something.   They were no longer helpless.   So the Project was a success in the terms of Adult Education where the student is in charge of his learning and his goals, but it cannot be claimed that it dramatically improved the standard of literacy throughout the county.   It certainly did not produce the significant and objectively documented successes of the three other schemes discussed here.</p>


<h3>COMPARISON OF THE FOUR PROGRAMMES:</h3>

<p>What are the factors which made three of these schemes so successful and which were missing from the Adult Literacy Project?</p>


<p>They were designed to deal with different groups of people.   The Japanese system is the regular one for all the children and makes no discrimination among different learners although some of them obviously get on much better and faster than others.   In New Zealand all the children are tested but only the strugglers receive the "intensive care" of the Reading Recovery programme because only they need it.   The Army  SPE tests were similarly applied to all soldiers on entry, but the course took only those who, again, were deemed to need it.   The Adult Literacy students were self-selected, people who were themselves dissatisfied with their own achievements and wanted to upgrade them for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>There was no compulsion for the Adult Literacy students.   They could miss lessons and could drop out at any time and for any reason.   In Oxfordshire they were treated as ordinary students in Adult Education and paid for their tuition (this was unusual, as most authorities made the tuition free, but all members of this scheme were consulted and plumped, by a big majority, for paying the normal fee.   In fact there was little evidence of financial hardship among those students, though one can never know if there were other people put off coming forward because of the fee)</p>

<p>Once a man had joined the Army (compulsory during the National Service period) he had no choice about joining the SPE course except (post-National Service) to resign.   While he was on it everything was compulsory and he had no choice about attending lessons and all the other activities.</p>

<p>For the children in Japan and New Zealand there was no choice either, but they also had no idea that there could have been a choice.    None of the New Zealand children were aware that some of them were on a special regime.</p>

<p>The New Zealand children were equally unaware of any goals or incentives they might be working towards.   In Japan there is a target in a number of characters which children are required to learn each year.   However in both these operations there are precise targets set before the teachers so that the work is aimed at targets even though the pupils are unaware of them.   In the Army goals and targets were made very clear and it was clearly important for each man to reach them.   In the Literacy Scheme goals and targets were whatever each working pair agreed they were (in fact they did not necessarily have to agree as long as they were both happy to continue with what they were doing) and could change at any time or be abandoned.</p>

<p>Thus the important factor of incentives arises.   Some Adult Literacy students had well-defined goals, to get promotion in a job or to write a letter home and so on, but even in these cases there were no obvious serious consequences for them if they failed.   In the Army the consequences of failure were dire;  they would have to leave, find another job and forego the secure employment of their chosen career, chances of promotion, good pay, opportunities for travel, sport and social life, as well as valuable training for a trade, all of which they could expect to enjoy if they passed.   As we have seen above, unsurprisingly nearly all of them did pass.</p>

<p>The value placed on the work by those in authority has, I am sure, an influence on its success.   Of course it is unlikely that Infant School children concern themselves with what the Government thinks is important if only because the concept of government is still blissfully beyond their ken, but they know pretty well what their teachers and parents think is important and they, in turn, are aware of the general view of society.   The amount of money invested in any project may be a crude measure of how much it is valued but it is a clear and significant one.   New Zealand and the Army put a lot of money into their literacy programmes, thereby making it clear to everyone concerned their view of literacy as vital.   The Japanese express their regard, not by expenditure on well-furbished schools or small classes but by paying the teachers well and respecting them and by giving the Japanese lessons a patriotic title and the preponderant place in the curriculum  Here the Government waxed eloquent about their goodwill and desire to help illiterate people improve their lot and they sponsored a  lot of prime time broadcasting of the message on the BBC, but three million pounds to be spread over the whole of England and Wales for three years was what they actually invested in the work.   Even at 1975 values this could not fail to be recognised as being not so much a serious effort to solve a serious problem, more of a sympathetic-sounding cluck in the direction of some of their more unfortunate citizens.</p>

<p>The only way in which all these four, very different, operations aspired to the same goals and achieved them is in the understanding of the emotional accompaniment of learning and the absolute necessity or removing, as far as possible, the feelings of low self-esteem, fear and despair which come upon us all when we struggle to learn something and fail.   The children are not given the opportunity to fail, because the work is structured in a way that excludes marks, orders of merit or any formal comparisons of one pupil with another.   The adults were all already fully aware that they had failed with low self-esteem and lack of confidence thoroughly entrenched in their self-concepts, so that eliminating, or at least diminishing these negative feelings and replacing them with other feelings of optimism and determination to succeed was a primary consideration in the way the work was planned and implemented.   It was achieved in the Army by the creation of the cohesive and mutually supportive groups and in the Adult Literacy Scheme by the pairing of each individual student with one sympathetic tutor giving their time out of a desire to help.   In both those operations there was strong emphasis on demonstrating to the students that they could learn, indeed had already learned, a great deal.   If you doubt this, you spend the time you should be learning worrying about yourself, whether you can learn, whether you are going to be "shown up", whether you are going to fail again and whether, perhaps, it would be better not to risk trying?</p>

<p>To sum up, it is clear that this warm, supportive and unthreatening atmosphere in which all these operations were conducted is a vitally necessary ingredient of teaching people to read and write (not bad idea, probably, for teaching them everything else as well), but not a sufficient one if they are to have a serious chance of succeeding.   For that they also need rigorous demands, clear incentives, understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of succeeding and failing and the surrounding pressure of being part of a group all striving for similar objectives and all confident that all can achieve them.   I have been glad to have had my experience of the Adult Literacy Scheme, along with the opportunity to study these other systems, to help me understand better the elusive causes of success and failure in literacy.</p>

<p>You may notice that in these four accounts teaching methods don't feature at all and there is not much about "resources".   They are not the point.   These differing operations did not succeed or fail because of these things, so easily and conveniently blamed, but for quite different reasons, the attitudes of everyone involved, pupils or students, teachers and the authorities and because of the confident expectation that the skills were worth learning and that the learners could learn them if they wanted to.</p>
