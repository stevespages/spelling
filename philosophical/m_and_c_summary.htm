<h2>CONCLUSIONS FROM MY STUDY OF MARK AND CHARLIE</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS? EARLY EXPERIENCES:</h3>

<p>It was hard to find very much in the boys themselves to account for their failure to learn to spell.

<p>They were not at all alike, in general, as the case studies show, but they had had several similar and significant experiences earlier in their lives and at their different schools.

<p>They could see and hear normally, they were not clumsy, had no problems with orientation and could distinguish easily between right and left.   There was nothing wrong with them physically ? now at least.   They could both reason and argue and they spoke fluently with a good vocabulary.

<p>But they had both had health set-backs when they were younger and, significantly, at the time when they first started to go to school and to learn to read and write.   

<p>It is quite likely that they both suffered a period of ?high-frequency deafness? at that stage in their education.   This is a common temporary disorder and it often goes unnoticed.   It occurs when children have suffered from some infection (especially respiratory infection), particularly if their temperature has risen very high as it often does with small children.   It seldom appears to cause any trouble and gets better on its own after about six weeks.   But during that time the child seems to be able to hear perfectly well but is actually experiencing difficulty in making fine distinctions of sounds.   This is a crucially important thing to be able to do if you are learning about the letters of the alphabet and the sounds they make.   This is, of course, speculation on my part, since there is no record of the problem for either boy, but there wouldn?t be as, at that time at least, very few people knew that such a disorder existed.

<p>There is no record of Mark?s having had any particular problems in his first school, but that was the time when he had his tonsils removed, so he must have had some sort of respiratory symptoms.    Again, there would be no record even if he was struggling because of the education service?s reluctance to ?label? children.    This is laudable of course, but it is quite possible to notice and investigate a problem in a child of five without alarming him with a label. 

<p>Charlie had his asthma to contend with and always found reading and writing difficult.   His problems were investigated by the psychologist at the age of nine, by which time they had been a cause of concern to his teachers (and doubtless to his parents and certainly to himself) for four years.   The report emphasises his good all-round ability and high intelligence and the fact that the only thing he found difficult was literacy, which he approached ?with great uncertainty and unhappiness?.   He was also often aggressive with other children, a classic response to frustration.

<p>The other feature of their early life which they had in common was that they had both moved house and changed school, Charlie twice by the time he was eight.   Both boys strongly disliked change of this sort and Mark attributed all his problems to it.   The move had happened about the same time as he went to hospital for his tonsil operation. At the age of ten he refused to go on a school trip and even worried about having to spend a few hours with a neighbour if his mother had to go out.   Charlie missed his father, whose work took him away from home quite often.   They were great home-lovers.

<p>So I think it is reasonable to speculate that all those (very common) events had upset them, that their hearing had been mildly impaired just when they needed it most and when disruption of their lives was also taking place and that they associated all these things with learning to read and write.   They then got discouraged and fell further behind their classmates.   They don?t seem to have had any extra help at that stage.

<p>Both boys were also plagued by a younger sister.   Both sisters were outstandingly successful all round and great readers!    Both boys found them extremely irritating.

<p>However, we can hardly advocate trying to eliminate learning problems by banning younger sisters or moving house.   The boys had many advantages.   They lived in loving orderly families where they were very well cared for.   Neither family was rich but they had nice cars and holidays and fairly frequent treats.   They had accessible grandparents and other relatives whom they enjoyed visiting.   Their families were not ?bookish? and, except for the younger sisters (who were certainly not role models to them) there was little evidence of reading; television, sport and shopping were the main interest, as with many families.   They were both popular and good at sport.   But they were completely flummoxed by spelling and to a considerable extent it blighted their lives.   And they had ?given up? on spelling and writing and were concentrating on avoiding rather than learning them.

<h3>THE PARENTS:</h3>

<p>Their parents were, in each case, the catalyst for getting something done about their problems at last.   They were not content to let their sons? poor performance carry on and badgered the schools until they obtained the coveted ?Statement of Special Needs? which brought me in to tutor them.   The schools disapproved, arguing, correctly, that Mark and Charlie were not nearly as bad as several others of their pupils and disliking ?pushy? parents;  they were also inclined to blame their parents for the problem.

<p>But the parents were, in the end, a huge disappointment to me because they would not support me when I argued that the boys should have their ?extra? tuition outside their ordinary classroom hours, nor would they ever make them do any homework.   It seems obvious that, if you are behind with your work, you are unlikely to catch up with those who are not unless you do more of it than they do.   So when they were working with me they were missing parts of their ordinary schoolwork and they never did any homework for me at all.   I was surprised that they made as much progress as they did.   I was also shocked that those parents, who had put so much energy and dogged perseverance into getting the precious statement, seemed then to feel that they had done their bit and now the education service should do the rest without any input from them.   Charlie?s mother was a teacher.   

<h3>THE TEACHERS:</h3>

<p>Mark's teachers complained about his absence from their classes for 20% of the time.   The effect of this is much more disruptive in Primary schools than later because there is an integrated timetable so that he missed parts of activities in a completely arbitrary way and could not get back into the swing of them quickly when he did return.   He started by complaining bitterly as well, but settled down in our lessons and, in the end, from having been an enthusiastic participant in all his class activities, rather lost interest in them.   But they never supported my request for extra time.   

<p>Naturally neither boy was at all keen on the idea. 

<p>Charlie?s school had an ?enrichment programme? two afternoons a week and those were the times of our lessons.   The teachers did not warm to the idea of having to make a special arrangement for lessons in the lunch hour or before or after school.   In the second year I put my foot down and said I would come on Saturday mornings or not at all, whereupon everyone capitulated, Charlie, his parents and the teachers, but the school always made a terrible fuss about letting us into the room and so on and they claimed it ate into the school budget, as the caretaker had to be paid extra for unlocking the door.

<p>I thought that my experiences with these two boys answered the first question that would occur to anyone, i.e. what was wrong with them?   The answer seemed to be nothing except their inability to learn to spell and their fear of written tasks.   I felt sure that they could not have been born in this condition and that in both cases it must have been the result of their previous experience.   This raised the question, what else could have gone wrong?   There seemed to be three possible culprits, the English spelling system, the way they had been taught or emotional factors.

<p>These questions are discussed in other sections of this website.
