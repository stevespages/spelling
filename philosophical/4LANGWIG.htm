<h2>CHAPTER 4:  "I THINK ENGLISH IS A STUPID LANGWIG"</h2>

<p>I asked Charlie to write about Spelling.   Spelling was the only thing he found really difficult about his schoolwork, but the demand for it in school is so persistent and he found it so difficult that it had dominated his life there, put him on the Special Needs list, got him into frequent trouble as his frustration spilled over into aggression against all around him and turned this handsome, able, popular boy into an expensive problem for the education authorities and a source of serious worry to his parents, his teachers and, above all, to himself.   He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I do not like Spelling - when my techer asks meto spelle or right I Drawr sone thing inthe margen.   I think English is a stupid langwig and I do not like right-ing it.   I dont no if I would like righting it if the spelling was not hard."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was true, nearly all his writing was adorned with little pictures and doodles in the margin.   As I sat beside him watching him trying to get his thoughts down on paper, it was clear how much he recoiled from the task and how irresistible were all the delaying tactics he employed to avoid committing his shameful performance to paper for all to see.   He had good reason to see English as a stupid langwig.</p>

<p>Professor Noam Chomsky, on the other hand, sees it in quite a different light.   He calls the English spelling system a "near-optimal system" for representing the spoken language.   He is a greatly distinguished philosopher and linguist.   Which of these opinions is right and why are their views so far apart?</p>

<p>We need to settle this question because we do hear an awful lot of criticism of English spelling and, more seriously, children who are trying to learn it hear their elders running it down, which doesn't help them in their struggle.   If you want someone to master a system it is prudent, to say the least, not to keep telling them that the system is a rotten one, but this is what so many of us do.   It is probably kindly meant, perhaps referring delicately to our own early struggles with it (and subsequent triumph!) and expressing our solidarity with our pupils and our sympathy with their suffering.</p>

<p>This kind of thing may create the sort of temporary but comforting feeling of fellowship experienced by people drawn together by the need to face a common enemy, but it is ultimately demoralising for both learner and teacher.   What the learner needs is not to draw closer to the teacher, however desirable such an outcome may be generally, but to master the spelling system.   And this will come about more easily and effectively if the teacher knows enough about the spelling system to understand how it works in general and to be able to tell the learner the truth about it.   It would also help if the teacher knew how the learner's mind works when dealing with the written language but that is the subject of a later chapter.</p>

<p>I have found that most people think of Standard English Orthography, that is the English spelling system, as a system which was designed to be phonic, i.e. based on a regular correspondence between sounds and letters, but which fails in its duty so often as to be hardly worth calling a system at all.   Some even seem to suspect its architects (who were they?) of deliberately making it anarchic in order to keep its mastery as a perk for the elite.   Even those who are fond of it seem to love it for its faults.</p>

<p>These attitudes were summed up for me by the mothers of  two children in my study, whom I interviewed.   One, a teacher of  English to foreigners, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's totally, totally, totally illogical.   There's no way you can guess how a word is spelled if you don't know.   It's the only language you can say that about.   It's terrible.   I speak with authority, having students from many cultures."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She did speak with a great air of authority and, of course, because I was being the cool objective researcher, I made no attempt to put her right.   Her students, who were mostly Japanese, might have put her right about English being the only difficult language, but of course we all know how polite they are, and they clearly hadn't.   To be fair, she taught only the spoken language so had not had to give much thought to writing.   Her daughter, the subject in my study, was an extremely able, conscientious and in all ways satisfactory pupil and the support which she and her brother got from their parents was surely contributing greatly to the smoothness and success of their school careers.   It only goes to show that ignorance is not necessarily a calamity if your attitudes and expectations are helpful.   But it is if it leads you into despising what you have to teach and doubting your pupils' ability to learn it.</p>

<p>The other mother, charmingly, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I think it's beautiful and would be boring if it was regular.   I like the variety.   I can see it's difficult."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Her child, too, got good support and did well at school.</p>

<p>But others don't.   Their learning of spellings has not gone well and they have to try to struggle on against a background of grown ups who are perhaps shaky spellers themselves, who don't understand how the system works and who take a dim view of it;  they may go further and think it should be reformed to make it more "regular".   Many people feel this, but those who have tried to reform it have not succeeded.  Even people like the two I have quoted would surely prefer to be better informed if they knew they were mistaken and in the last resort we must surely prefer knowledge to ignorance.   Most people who do find out how the spelling system works find it rather interesting and enjoy the knowledge as well as reaping the practical advantages.   Unfortunately there are not many of them about.</p>

<p>I said above that we needed to settle the question of English spelling, whether it is "stupid" or near-optimal", but actually we probably don't.   It doesn't matter very much whether it is a good or bad system, because it is most unlikely to change.</p>

<p>There have been attempts to make it more "regular", but they have never succeeded.   Bernard Shaw devised a system which demonstrated how ignorant he was, for once, on this subject.   He had every opportunity to publicise it and did so but it never caught on.   The Americans made a lot of changes in the early part of the twentieth century and American writing did look quite distinctive for a while, but most of those new forms dropped out and we are left with labor for labour, center for centre, program for programme and other underwhelming variations.   American spelling is hardly revolutionary and does not take on the bugbear words which are the cause of so much angst.</p>

<p>Sir James Pitman created ITA, the Initial Teaching Alphabet, which is actually a wonderful system.   It is probably as near as one can get to being phonically regular and it does make it easy to learn to read quickly.   What is particularly clever about it is that the tops of the letters are similar to their conventional counterparts;  we look at the tops of the letters far more than at the bottoms when we read, so that when the learner comes to move across to reading conventional writing the transition is wonderfully smooth.   It has been used with great success not only for teaching children but also for teaching adults who are poor readers;  for them it can be introduced as a completely different method from the one with which they failed as children, so that they can start again, untroubled by memories of their previous confusion.   There was a serious effort to introduce its use in primary schools and many pupils and their teachers loved it.   But it has not survived.</p>

<p>Why not?   I said it got near to being phonically regular and we must know precisely what that means.   It means that each letter represents a single sound so that there should be able to be a one-to-one relationship between sound and letter.   This does very nearly happen in some languages like Italian, Spanish and (I am told) Finnish, but it could never be possible in English.   This is because there are at least 44 different sounds in spoken English and only 26 letters of our alphabet and because we don't all speak alike.   Especially with the vowels, there are huge variations depending on where speakers come from, their age and social class.   But they exist with the consonants as well.   Think of all those "r"s which turn up all the time in Scottish speech and the erratic behaviour of "h" sounds everywhere.   There are many other examples.      However hard you try, you can't reflect the sounds of English speech with a single system even if you confine it to the speech of a particular group.   There is huge variation here, but even more across the world, where English is spoken and written as mother-tongue, second language, business language, common foreign language and pronounced in ways that are sometimes mutually incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Another reason why the ITA was not widely adopted is that books written in it could not be produced in great enough numbers to make it profitable for publishers.   You would have to have had a lot of books with that typeface sold for children to read on their own to back up their classroom reading and, unless it had been adopted by about 80% of schools, this would never have happened.   The book trade relies on printers and publishers and they must be able to make a profit.   All the same, the ITA was a most useful experiment illuminating our understanding of children’s reading, of English spelling and how to teach both.</p>

<p>Of course, our spelling system is fundamentally phonic and of course the letters do represent sounds.   But they don’t do it in the “one-letter-one-sound-moving-from-left-to-right” way that is often assumed.   There are only 26 letters but there are a lot of combinations of letters which behave like single letters to give us representations of more sounds.   Funnily enough these “letter-strings” or letter-patterns” are often more consistent than the single letters themselves (word, work, worm, worth:  -tion and -sion) and we should be encouraged to notice and learn them more than we do.</p>

<p>Moreover things other than sound are represented in our spelling.   Grammar for instance.   Most people do not notice the different sounds which occur at the ends of the words, "wanted", "warned" and "worked", but they are different.  If you say them and attend to the sound you will hear that "wanted" has two syllables and ends in a "d";  "warned" has one syllable and also ends in a "d";  "worked" has one syllable but it ends in a "t".   Psychologists have conducted trials with volunteers from all sorts of backgrounds and the overwhelming majority are against changing those spellings because they don't notice the discrepancies in sound as they read (you don't notice them as you speak either, until it is drawn to your attention) but the consistent "ed" pattern helps because it marks the past tense and that helps the reader.   It is only one case among many where the uniformity in the spelling conflicts with sound-symbol uniformity and is all the more helpful for doing so.</p>

<p>The silent e would surely go if we were to reform our spelling, but we should certainly miss it and I greatly doubt if anyone could find a satisfactory replacement for it.   The fact that it is silent certainly does not mean that it is unimportant.</p>

<p>It has several uses.   It indicates pronunciation, predicts stress, distinguishes homophones, distinguishes English words from foreign ones - in two separate ways- and preserves certain spelling patterns.   Readers make effective use of all these functions.</p>
 
<p>Again, meaning is an important factor in our spelling.   English undoubtedly has more homophones than any other European language, that is words which sound the same but have different meanings.   Week/weak, some/sum, hole/whole are examples and, of course, notoriously, there/their and to/too/two.  These are not obscure words which occur only occasionally in what we read and write, but extremely common ones impossible for anyone to avoid.   They do not represent a failure of the phonic spelling system;   they represent a second system, not phonic but based on meaning, which is also at work in our spelling and which helps the reader.   “Different Spelling Different Meaning” is not a bad slogan for someone learning to spell.</p>

<p>There are a few, but only very few, words of the opposite persuasion, row/row, which means either a line or a verbal fight or an aquatic activity according to the way you pronounce it, and can also be either a verb or a noun, so back to grammar again.</p>

<p>The fact is that English is a mixed language, coming from two main sources, Latin and Teutonic, as well as some other minor ones, so it is hardly surprising that it should have evolved a mixed spelling system.   If you are thinking purely in phonic terms you will not appreciate the spellings of the words sign/signal and medicine/medical, cases where the spelling disregards the phonic rule, but keeps the related meanings of these pairs of words by incorporating the same letter-string.   Writing, after all is for reading and the reader's perception of it is dominated by sight, which is our most powerful and reliable sense, rather than hearing.   We don't go around saying, "I shan't believe that till I hear it";  rather we are much more likely to hear it and mistrust it until we see it.   Seeing is believing and seeing is a big part of reading and therefore necessarily of spelling.</p>

<p>Other influences on our spelling are our long history of exploration of the world and involvement with other peoples and languages which we have imported into our own.   Sometimes we have anglicised them (orange/naranja), sometimes imported them intact (restaurant, barrage), sometime both at once (garage, pronounced either as English, garridge, or French, garage).   However these words are not really a problem because we don't use them all that often in our writing and they usually stick in our memory when we do come across them because of their peculiarity.   But they make wonderful material for the discontented critics of the system because they do not conform to a regime of strict phonics.</p>

<p>Another reason why an exclusively phonic, sound-to-symbol approach couldn’t work is that we cannot hear all the sounds of our words clearly.   We can hear the monosyllables with the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, which are nearly always the first words that children are asked to read and write.   The cat sat on the mat causes no problem (the is pretty odd and has two different pronunciations, but is also so common that everyone learns that straight away and never thinks how odd it is) and the man got on the bus likewise.   All the sounds can be clearly heard and they all conform unambiguously to one of the 26 letters.   That is why reading and writing often go with a swing to start with and wobbles and struggles start a bit later when longer words are used.   And these are all the more demoralising because it all seemed such a doddle at the beginning.</p>

<p>This is because English is a highly stressed language.   With each word that we say we pronounce one syllable only (usually, but not always, the first) clearly and the rest are swallowed.   The butcher, the baker and the candlestick-maker are all spelt the same at the end and they do rhyme, but why are they different from the actor, the sailor and  Labour?   No-one can hear any difference between the last syllables of those words and incidentally they can’t hear the r s at the ends of the words either, unless they are emphatically rolled in a way that most of us don’t do.   In fact that nondescript sound (an unstressed vowel) is called a schwa and is the commonest sound in English.   And there are a lot of different ways of expressing it in our spelling, often related to meaning.   Most of us get them fixed in our visual memories early in life and never think again of their phonic discrepancies, but that makes it more difficult to notice the trouble they may cause to a conscientious learner and they are one more important reason why insistence exclusively on phonics can have such disastrous results and why, when we are trying to learn to write them, we must always look at words as well as listening to them.</p>

<p>Phonics is a system that lets you down just when you need it most, said Dr. Margaret Peters.   It is an excellent system and very necessary to the learning of reading and writing, but it is not sufficient and it can too often be extremely misleading.   If it is over-emphasised, misunderstood and overused, as it so often is, its influence is baleful.    It causes endless trouble when used in isolation and without understanding of its limitations.</p>

<p>My personal experience of teaching a large number of poor spellers is that almost every one of them has been working with only one approach, the phonic one, unaware that there was any other principle at work, but, at the same time, miserably very much aware that too often it wasn’t working.   That is what leads to all this criticism of English spelling and the dreary feeling that some of us are trying to teach, and others to learn, a system which is sometimes systematic, but often a total mess.   It does often let you down just when you need it most, but that is because you haven’t understood that it is not the only system;  you don’t know that there are other systems, nor what they are, how they work or how to apply them</p>

<p>It has often been suggested that the difficulty some people find in learning to spell arises from this disorderly language and that writers of English are uniquely unfortunate in this respect.   When I have heard this I have wondered what happens to the learners of other languages.   What about Japanese writing, which is amazingly complex and difficult language, but Japanese people do learn it and they are one of the most generally literate populations in the world.   More than 90% of them reach the standard of our A Level and the great majority go on to University.   It is worth  having a quick look at what they have to master in their writing system to perform these impressive feats.</p>

<p>Japanese writing is an even more mixed system than English.   It is based on Chinese characters, which were brought to Japan, rather late in its history, by the Koreans.   Chinese characters suit the Chinese language, but they are ill-adapted for Japanese which is a completely different kind of language from Chinese.    The characters are used for the lexical words, which are words which tell you what the writing is about (trees or porpoises or dancing etc.)   But Japanese has grammatical words which hardly exist in Chinese (pronouns, conjunctions and prepositions, telling you whose porpoises are dancing round the trees and when - Chinese hardly goes in for grammar at all and has been described as being like sending a telegram) so they have had to create a completely separate system for these words and then another completely separate system for all the foreign words which keep coming into a language and for which neither of the other two systems cater.</p> 

<p>So there are three separate systems at work in all Japanese writing.   It was probably made so complicated partly because of the intrinsic incompatibility of the spoken language and its alien written form but also because at first only an elite group were expected to write and they were people who had a lot of time on their hands and needed a time-consuming and challenging occupation.   Writing has probably always started everywhere as the preserve of a privileged group and universal literacy is a very recent development.</p>

<p>There is no question that Japanese children are expected to work very hard and to persevere to learn to use their writing, but only the tiniest minority fail to do it and this must surely be strong evidence, if not conclusive proof, that, whatever else it is, it is not the difficulty or our spelling system which causes so much failure here.</p>

<p>What is more, there is a pay-off between readers and writers in all the systems.   If the writing is to be user-friendly for readers, then it will demand more effort from writers.   Japanese, Chinese and (to a much lesser degree) English do require a bigger effort than phonically regular alphabetic languages to write but they provide readers with an easily absorbed and highly informative text.   Everybody, even professional writers, read much more than they write.  Sophisticated readers are more numerous and undoubtedly more influential in the world than struggling spellers and those who teach and sympathise with them, so that the balance of power lies heavily on the side of keeping our writing system rather than changing it for the doubtful benefit of learners.</p>

<p>More powerful still in this respect are the printers.   It is mostly they who have decided on the spelling of our words and the history of English spelling is full of their influence ever since printing began with William Caxton.   Caxton is a case in point.   Have you ever wondered why we have so many words containing the letters gh in the middle which are not pronounced.   It seems that this is because William Caxton was brought up in Holland, where they still have the gh letter-pattern and it is still pronounced.   Apparently Caxton spoke English all his life with a strong Dutch accent and, when he set up his printing press, he spelled the words as he pronounced them.   Once a press is set up it is a big job to reset it and the more time has gone on and the more English and printing have spread all over the world the more unlikely it becomes that the presses will be changed.   The history of English spelling is full of quirky stories like that, doubtless very irritating to people with tidy minds and a taste for reform, but demonstrating the huge difficulty of introducing wholesale change.</p>

<p>It can be done and has been.   The Germans gave up their picturesque but difficult Gothic script in the 20th century and the Turks adopted the Roman alphabet - with festoons of diacritical marks all over their writing, but nevertheless it seems to work - when Ataturk insisted on their being modernised and westernised all round.   The Chinese too have developed Pin Ying, a Romanised alternative way of writing for some purposes while not abandoning their strange and beautiful script.   All these people had strong , practical incentives for the changes they introduced.   My argument is that we have not got that kind of incentive and those who argue for the reform of English spelling have never been able:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"to propose a principled system sufficiently exhaustive and detailed to survive detailed analysis and experimentation by linguists, psychologists and educators"   (Sterling 1992)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would have to be so clearly better that it would be worth the struggle and expense of introducing it.   It is hard to see that happening.</p>  

<p>Our conclusion must be that running down Standard English Orthography and yearning for its reform are no answer to our difficulties in teaching people to spell.   The time and emotional energy would be better employed in learning how our system works and how our own and our children’s minds work when they are learning it.   We would then come to admire and praise it and teach it effectively, thus saving everyone a very great deal of toil, angst, expense and human misery.</p>
