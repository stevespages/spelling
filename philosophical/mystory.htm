<h2>HOW I CAME TO STUDY SPELLING</h2>

<p>People who learn to read and write easily and quickly usually can?t remember the process at all.   I can because I had a bit of difficulty.   I was never worried about it and must have got over it very quickly because I could read when I went to school and soon became a bookworm.

<p>I am sure this came about because the conditions under which I learned to read were ideal.   I had a nanny who gave me my first lessons before I went to school.   I was clumsy and untidy and very confused about some of the letters, especially their orientation.   My name, <i>Susan</i>, is a good name for writing back-to-front and upside-down and I did a lot of that.   I was told much later that they were worried about me, but I was quite unaware of it.   I thought it was a very difficult and grown-up thing to be doing and all the more interesting for that reason.   I am quite sure that no notion that I might fail to learn it ever entered my head.   In fact, unbeknownst to everyone involved, I was receiving an ideal Literacy Programme!</p.

<p>After that I enjoyed school and got on well.   A friend at school, much later, once told me she hadn?t been able to read until she was nine and it stuck in my head because I was very surprised as she was rather successful.   

<p>We have four children and the first three learned to read and write and did well at school, so it was a bit of a shock when my husband happened to bump into our youngest child?s teacher and she casually mentioned that he was not making progress with his reading and writing.   This had never been mentioned before in his reports and it was the era of keeping parents out of schools at all costs, so we had seldom spoken to a teacher, if at all.   I did ring up the headmaster, but got no help from him.   No-one thought highly of that school and, as we were about to move, he was going to change schools in any case.   So we didn?t worry too much and hoped there were better things to come.   Moreover I remembered my clever friend and kept calm.

<p>His next school was much better.   No-one understood the problem but they tried their best to help him and he did improve.    Above all, the school was extremely good at treating all their pupils as valuable and important, whatever their achievements.   But they strongly believed in competition and there were frequent mark readings, so that he was, and felt, a ?marked man?, a by-word for being witty, interesting and fun, but a hopeless scholar.   And he was very naughty, the classic response of a clever but frustrated child.   At fifteen he suddenly improved, passed his exams and ended his education with the highest academic qualifications in the family.   But he had a rotten time on the way and got very little useful help.   Someone suggested <i>Dyslexia</i>, the first time I heard that word.

<p>When the children were older I became a teacher and encountered pupils with similar problems over and over again.   They too were clever but their written work was awful and they were clearly frustrated and unhappy.   We now heard the word <i>Dyslexia</i> quite often and it had become a talking-point in educational circles, but there was very little explanation of the term and almost no suggestions about how to deal with it.

<p>So for the next nine years I worked on the literacy problem.   I studied with Major Colin Stevenson, who had worked with soldiers at the British Army?s School of Preliminary Education and assisted with some of the teaching.   There is an account of the PSE?s successful regime on this website.   I then set up the Oxfordshire County Council?s Literacy Scheme and ran it for eight years.   Our work is also described on the website.

<p>The Literacy Scheme produced many surprises.   One was that again and again our students arrived saying, ?It?s not my reading, it?s my spelling!?   At that time, apart from the army and some work in prisons, there were very few people who had any experience of teaching adults to read and write.   Infant teachers had taught both, of course, but only to small children.   Others had taught adults but had not taught them to read.   The Literacy Scheme had been launched by the Government and the BBC and they gave us a lot of advice and support, but it was all about reading.   Writing and spelling were almost ignored.   However, I had attended a lecture by Dr. Margaret Peters, which had persuaded me of the importance of spelling and of the necessity of tackling it wisely and early.   She also made me see what an absorbingly interesting subject it is in its own right.

<p>So I continued in my job, but went to Birmingham University part-time to learn more and to try to fill the gap.   I was lucky that one of the PhD. Students was studying children?s spelling and there was also a member of Mari Clay?s team working there for several months.   They had recently launched the Reading Recovery Programme in New Zealand, which was proving, and has continued to prove, extremely successful.   There is an account of Reading Recovery here too.   I got a great deal of help from both these people and the New Zealand scholar came to talk to our Literacy Scheme in Oxford.   I produced a study, <i>Adults? Spelling Difficulties</i>, based on the experiences of students and tutors in Oxfordshire.

<p>I continued in teaching when I left Oxford but not specifically in Literacy.   But I never lost interest in the spelling problem (there is always a lot of it about, wherever you are teaching).   By the nineties I considered that quite enough was now known about spelling for schools to be able to avoid the shockingly high rate of failure in our schools.   However it is not known to the teachers and the interest that it once briefly aroused seems to have evaporated again.   I undertook another research study, a much bigger one this time, and produced <i>Attitudes and Expectations in the Learning and Teaching of Spelling</i>.   It is based on sixteen children:  detailed studies of two boys, to whom I gave individual tuition over two years, and amore general one of fourteen children in their last year of Primary and first year of Secondary School.   I observed the way writing was dealt with in their lessons and interviewed the children themselves, their parents and the teachers concerned.   I also, of course, studied a wide range of scholarly research.  There is much about that work on the website.

<p>I am now sure that we do not need to have such a big problem with literacy as we do and that we could prevent it arising in most people effectively and cheaply.   What is needed is for those in charge of teacher training and of the teaching of small children to understand the way the spelling system works and the way the children?s minds work.   This would lead them to realise that most people are perfectly capable of learning to spell, if sensibly taught and managed, and that spelling is a vital ingredient of everything else (almost) that goes on in school, including, especially, reading.

<p>Most people in difficulties with spelling believe that it is an inborn gift or knack, with which some people are blessed and others not.   They hear a great deal of criticism of our spelling system, which makes them feel that it doesn?t work properly and will be very hard to learn; often they feel it isn?t worth learning, often that it is only something you need to do at school, so you will escape from it for ever when you are sixteen.   Above all they feel that there is something wrong with them and that they will never be able to learn it.

<p>Although I have spent a lot of my time ?teaching people to spell and read?, a huge proportion of the work has not been that, rather I have been demonstrating to them that they do need to learn it, that they will find it useful all their lives, that ours is a good system which does work.  Most important of all I have shown them what a huge amount they have managed to learn already (nearly always) and that they can learn more.   In the end it is our attitudes to our tasks and our expectations of those tasks and of ourselves that are the decisive factors in whether we succeed or not.

<p>But it is hard work and it is more difficult when you have to unlearn what you learned wrongly in the past and it would be much better if we taught them properly in the first place! 

<p>I have made some efforts to get my work published but have been unsuccessful, so now, with the help of my son, who understands computing, I am putting it on the internet, where I hope it will be useful to people who struggle with this too common problem.
