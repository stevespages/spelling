<P>If you want to get started straight away with improving your spelling or helping someone else with theirs, click on <A HREF="learning.htm">Learning Individual Words</A> and then on <A HREF="firstthi.htm">First Things First: How to Select the Words to Study</A>.   These two pages tell you all you need to know to get on with the job of becoming a more confident and successful speller.

<P>But you might also like to know more about the problem and to understand both the causes of shaky spelling and the reasons behind the advice given here, so there is more on other pages.

<P>Is it our spelling system?   People do complain a lot about it.   Is it too difficult to learn and, if so, why don't we change it?   Click on <A HREF="ourspell.htm">Our Spelling System<A/>

<P>Many uncertain spellers wonder what happened to them.  Was there something wrong with them or is there just a lucky "gift" for spelling which they missed out on?   Will they be able to learn now?   Click on <A HREF="agiftfor.htm">A Gift for Spelling?</A>.

<P>Is it the teachers' fault?   Click on <A HREF="teaching.htm">Teaching</A>

<P>What else could it be?   Click on <A HREF="whatelse.htm">What Else?</A>

<P>Some people think we shouldn't make such a fuss about spelling and that it doesn't matter how you write words.  So there is a page on <A HREF="whybothe.htm">Why Bother Anyway?</A>

<P>If you would like to know where these ideas come from, my name is Susan Greig and I am a teacher and researcher with degrees in languages and educational psychology.   So the ideas come from my experience of teaching adults and children and of studying the workings of the language and of the way our minds work with it.
