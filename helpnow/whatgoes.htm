<P>Why is there such a problem with spelling for some people?   What does go wrong?

<P>It seems to me there are four things it could be.   It could be any one of them, or a
combination or, worst of all, a ghastly conspiracy of the whole lot together to do us
down.   So I shall look at each in turn.

<P>1.   It could be <A HREF="thespell.htm">The Spelling System</A> itself.   Lots of people think it is a
confusing mess.   Is that what you think?   

<P>2.   Lots of people also think there is <A HREF="agiftfor.htm">A Gift for Spelling</A> and they think some of us are
just born with it and others miss out.   Is this true and, if it is, is there any hope for
those who haven't got this gift?

<P>3.   Is it the <A HREF="teaching.htm">Teaching</A>?   We rather like blaming our teachers for the things that go
wrong in our lives.   Perhaps it is all their fault?   Click on Teaching.

<P>4.   Whatever you're doing, you hardly ever do it in a complete vacuum, cut off from
the outside world.   There are almost always <A HREF="otherfac.htm">Other Factors</A> and it is no different
when you are learning to spell   It isn't only what we are learning about, how clever or
attentive we are or even how skilful and learned our teachers are that make the whole
difference.   All these things are important, of course, but you learn in a school and in a
class or at home on your own or with brothers and sisters and all these things and
people probably have quite a big influence on what you do.   There are your beliefs and
feelings and, above all, the influence of your parents, family and friends.
