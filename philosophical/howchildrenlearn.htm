<h3>HOW  CHILDREN  LEARN  TO  READ  AND  WRITE</h3>

<p>Children learning about their world are small scientists.   They collect information by observing people and things and noticing what goes on around them.   Then they use these observations as evidence, from which they form hypotheses about how their world works   Then they try them out to see if they can work the system themselves.   Of course they often find they can't because they still haven't got enough information or their hypotheses are wrong and they have to modify them.   Sometimes they have to abandon them altogether and start again.   This hypothesising, testing, modifying and trying again is what scientists do.   Grown-up scientists are equipped with purpose-built laboratories and hi-tech instruments but children are equipped with magic Seven League Boots in the shape of a seemingly miraculous ability to pick up information, store it and fit it into their ever-developing picture of the world, all at high speed.   The amount of knowledge and skill they acquire about language in the firsr few years of their lives is a constant source of wonder and admiration to their grown-ups.</p>

<p>An enormous amount of this sort of activity goes on, often unnoticed, long before any teaching of literacy takes place.   A South American study found that pre-school children had firm ideas about the written language and how it worked long before they ever tried to learn to read or write themselves    They knew the difference between writing and drawing, they knew that writing was always linear and must be confined to a limited set of symbols and they knew the difference between letters and figures and never mixed them up.</p>

<p>In fact they already knew a lot at the ages of three and four, but there was also much that that they did not know,.   They were still thinking in purely visual terms and could not yet accept any connection between writing and sound.   They thought that the word for <i>cock</i> should be bigger than that for <i>hen</i> because the cock is bigger.   In Spanish cock and hen are <i>gallo</i> and <i>gallina</i>  respectively , but the children found that impossibly absurd.   A small boy called <i>Alejandro</i> would not accept the written version of his father's name, <i>Ramon</i>, "because he is so much bigger than me!"   He had not yet let go of the time when the only way something could be represented on paper was by drawing a picture of it.</p>

<p>Another of their firm convictions was that words must have a minimum of three letters, so that they refused to "see" articles and prepositions if they had only two.   This refusal is not just a mistake because it always occurs and no amount of patient explanation will shift it, until the children's own "experiments" have convinced them.   It is significant that in English, apart from ox (and ox may count as a three-letter word because technically x counts as ks), there are no lexical words with less than three letters and I doubt if there are any in Spanish or other alphabetically-written languages. </p>

<p>Lexical words are the nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs which tell you what it is we are writing (or talking) about.   The other words, including all the one-and two- letter ones are grammatical words, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions and articles.   These mean nothing on their own, they must always appear with lexical words and their function is to mark the relationships among the lexical words.   The South American studies have been repeated in many other countries with exactly the same results and it looks as if small children grasp a profound principle of language very early - that what is important is meaning and they decide that meaningless words can't be read.   One rather wishes that some adult writers felt like that.</p>

<p>It is therefore unfortunate in the extreme that one of the first tasks a child is given on entering many primary schools in Britain is to "read" a Word Card like the one shown here</p>

<p>  Almost all can read Mummy, Daddy and School, which are words of huge significance to them anyway, as well as being of an interesting shape and a "proper" length, as they feel, but the rest are at best useless as learning tasks and for many counter-productive.   They are mostly grammatical words, meaning nothing on their own and several of them have only two letters.   What this means is that those who can read them have progressed beyond this stage, so the exercise is one which teachers should always avoid if they can, i.e. teaching somebody something they know already.   Those who can't read them can't yet be taught to do so because they have not yet been convinced that such pairs of letters are words at all.   A child who is beginning to get the idea of reading and who is faced with these words is likely to feel confused and non-plussed. </p>

<p>In fact isolated words are always to be avoided.   We don't speak or write in isolated words and in order to make sense of any word, we often need the words that surround it, not to mention some kind of story or argument to fit it into.   Children come to accept the little words quite painlessly at a later stage by reading stories, where these little words come into their own and do have meaning because they provide the vital links between the important lexical words.</p>

<p>The South American children also showed a surprisingly sophisticated understanding of genre.   The experimenters tried reading aloud to them from different kinds of texts, but apparently taken from unlikely sources.   They would take up a brightly coloured book of Nursery Rhymes and read, apparently from it, a factual account of a street robbery or traffic accident.   Nearly all the children would say, "That doesn't come from that book!" or "That's from a newspaper!"   They knew that Fairy Tales didn't come from Cookery Books or Motor Bike Manuals, even though they could as yet read nothing themselves.   They have a great deal of Knowledge About Language, an important prerequisite of reading or writing.</p>

<p>The messages to teachers from such studies are numerous and important and I used to hope that think they were trickling through into our classrooms but now I doubt it.   Teachers have recognised for a long time that children arrived at school with very different degrees of "reading readiness".   Many children without this precious asset are not just dim or poor or brain-damaged or cursed with unsuitable parents;  often they have just been doing something else at the time when their classmates have been working on mastering the written language.   Gervase Finn, who tells entertaining stories drawn from his experience as a Schools Inspector in Yorkshire recounts a visit he made to assess a boy who seemed to have learning "difficulties".   During their conversation the boy displayed such detailed knowledge of sheep, along with the ability to explain it all to Finn that the Inspector left wondering which one it was of them that had the learning difficulties.   He couldn't read well, but a reason for that may have been that he had little time to spare for reading. Not having done it is not necessarily the same thing as not being able to do it.</p>

<p>It is clearly necessary to provide this kind of preparatory experience to children before you try to teach them formally to read.   But this is just what can't be done in a classroom full of children who must be taught formally and together for most of the time.   It is an ideal activity for Nursery Schools and Play Groups, with their emphasis on informal learning through play and with a high ratio of adults to children, but not every child gets to attend one of these and there is now a most unfortunate trend to encourage parents to place their children in formal schooling even before the statutory age of five, which is already too early in many people's opinion.</p>

<p>So the teachers recognise the problem but, even if they knew what to do about it, it is simply not possible to give these unprepared children what they need in to-day's overcrowded and over-regulated classrooms.</p>

<p>What then are the normal processes by which children learn to read and write?   There are of course differing opinions, but the version that seems by far the most credible to me is that they start off identifying whole words and letters in the same way that they identify everything else in their world - that is Mummy, that is R for Rosie (my name), that is M for Mimi (our cat), that is a chair, chocolate, teddy bear and so on.   Lucky children get read to, sitting cosily beside the reader looking at the texts and the pictures and sometimes joining in identifying words and letters, anticipating what is going to happen in the story then reading on to see if it does.   Most of us are familiar with the scene.   They are hearing a story and usually enjoying it, learning a few bits of the written language, learning about writing and the ways in which it differs from speaking.   They do it because it is fun and interesting and when they get bored they wriggle off your knee to go and pursue another interest.   They have no idea that this is important training for the future and certainly don't see it as a duty.</p>

<p>A feature of toddlerhood, which is puzzling and often extremely annoying to grown-ups, is their insistence on having the same story read over to them again and again and their further insistence on every word (which they have clearly memorised  - so why don't they tell themselves the story you sometimes, sourly, think) being correct and in its proper place.   Most parents have experienced the frustration of trying to whizz through the bedtime story so as not to be late for an evening engagement, only to be frustrated by a merciless demand for the full, unexpurgated text.    You know you are going to have to give in so you do read it all and usually you are late.   Such children are probably not "playing up" or testing your commitment to them.   They are teaching themselves a fact of life, that this new medium is not fluid and evanescent like speech, but the writing on the page is permanent;  it is always the same every time and can't be altered.   If you tell a story you can alter the details and make up a different ending, but if you are reading it conscientiously from the page you can't.   It is one example of children's functioning as "self-teaching machines" and of their dogged commitment to patient repetition in pursuit of mastery of another feature of their world.    Inexhaustible "why?" questions are another.   They are pursuing what is the central task of their life and you should be pleased and give in most of the time, even if everyone else thinks you are discourteous and unpunctual and that you spoil your children.</p>

<p>To start with, while this recognition of words and letters (and numbers) is going on, there is no attempt at phonic analysis.   You may mention  that R stands for a particular sound and even "sound out" the word, but the child will not at first be ready for that,.   They just recognise a set of black squiggles on white paper visually and connect it with a particular person or object which they know.</p>

<p>The next stage is when they perceive the connection between the writing and sound and understand that although Rosie on the page does indeed represent the real Rosie whom we can see and touch, it also represents the word, Rosie, which is already itself a symbol for the real Rosie.   This is why it is so important for children to practise writing alongside their reading.   It starts with learning to hold a pencil and making scribbles at random and often nobody knows what these scribbles mean.   Children will say, "What did I write?", believing that the letters themselves hold the meaning and expecting their grown - ups to interpret them rather like Homer who had to ask the Muse to tell him what to write (the idea of "self-expression" is a rather modern one)   Their perception of the link between sound and symbol comes about through starting to write names and words because, when writing, if you haven't got a mental picture of a word or an example of it to copy from, the clues can only come from sound.</p>

<p>Thus children start to read by recognising whole words globally without analysing how they are constructed and they start to write phonically by analysing the sounds in words, relating them to appropriate letters and writing them down in the order in which they hear them.   These are separate strategies and a crucial moment in their development of mastery of the written language comes when they combine these two techniques and start to use both of them, as appropriate, for both reading and writing,.   They think about the sound and work out what the word is from the sounds of the letters they see now, as well as just recognising the whole word, and they conjure up a picture of the word as well as listening to its sounds when they are writing.   This is one of the vital moments in their learning when progress can falter or stop because they have failed to blend these two separate strategies together.   At least one respected study provides strong evidence that spelling "drives" reading and this means that children who make good progress in spelling right at the start soon begin not only to spell better but also to read better even than the children who were at first ahead of them in reading but less good at spelling.</p>

<p>Understanding all these processes is very important for teachers because they need to assess the stages of development that their pupils have reached if they are to help them to continue.   Moreover it is vital for them to appreciate the importance of early writing and spelling because these have been so often played down with disastrous results.   Teachers do not like "labelling" children and they are right, but that does not mean that they are right to hide from <i>themselves</i> the fact that someone is getting into difficulties.   We know for certain that intervention at the first sign of trouble is much more likely to be successful than "catch-up" efforts later.</p> 

<p>Kindly teachers often feel sorry for pupils who are struggling and they encourage them to concentrate on reading for the time being, considering that (as I think most of us do) reading is the more important and useful skill and it won't matter so much if the children get behind a bit with their writing.   In fact it does matter very much indeed.</p>

<p>Doing research into children's intellectual development has been great fun for some people.   One teacher, G. Bissex, at home on maternity leave with her small son, Paul, made a minutely detailed study of him as he learned gradually to spell.   She reported what he did and then a scholarly analysis of her data was made by another researcher, J. R. Gentry, who compared it with his own much more comprehensive study of large numbers of children engaged in the same task.   He suggested that there were five distinct phases in the process:</p>

<p>It starts with the <strong>Precommunicative Stage</strong>, when the child who has already been drawing pictures for some time begins to make other kinds of marks on paper, still scribbles but of a different kind.   They begin to have some of the features of writing.   Some of the shapes look a bit like letters, but often in different orientation.   The distinguishing thing about them is that they are linear.   They may go from left to right or top to bottom, in many directions, but they continue in the same direction and the child thinks of them as writing.   S/he does not yet think of them as having anything to do with sound, but does know that they have meaning without knowing  (or expecting to know) what their meaning is.   It is a great leap forward.</p>

<p>The next stage is <strong>Semiphonetic</strong> when the child knows the names of some of the letters at least and has grasped that they stand for sound.   Paul Bissex got fed up with his mother one day when she insisted on talking to a friend instead of listening to him.   Unable to get her attention by speaking, he wrote her a note and put it in front of her.  It read, "RUDF", meaning, "Are you deaf?"  He was using the names of three of those letters to represent the sounds he wanted to express and using the D in the conventional phonic way.    Another advance:  he now knew that the letters were connected with sounds but thought that that letter names stood for the sounds they resembled.   This is understandable and very many children use the letter names in this way, but teachers, on seeing this, do not always understand that, although it is unquestionably incorrect, it is an encouraging stage on the road to good spelling.   At that time he wrote KR for <i>car</i> and BZR for <i>buzzer</i>, and, although he didn't often recognise vowel sounds at this stage, he did write TELEFNMBER for <i>telephone number</i>.   He was making hypotheses, testing them and making jerky progress all the time.</p>

<p>The ancient Semites, from whom the Phoenicians, then the Greeks and, finally, we got the alphabet, didn't have symbols for vowels either;  they didn't need them;  Arabic and Hebrew often don't use them to-day.   The Greeks added vowels because their language did need them for writing their language and so do we.   There is an attractive idea that a child learning to write (and other skills) goes through the same stages as the whole human race has done in its development of writing, but much more swiftly.   I do hope it is true.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the study of Paul Bissex was entitled "GNYS AT WRK;  A Child Learns to Write and Read."   Paul, who seems to have had his mother well under control, had put this phrase as a forbidding notice on his bedroom door and it reads, "Genius at Work" - he did this when he was in his Semiphonetic Stage.</p>

<p>An important feature of this stage is that there is a very erratic use of spacing.   The child knows that there are spaces in writing but not how they work    This is because s/he is becoming aware that the language is made up of separate words, but cannot yet be sure where each word begins and ends.   One of the first things tested by the Reading Recovery Teachers (see Chapter10) is whether the pupils know the difference between a letter and a word and between a word and a sentence.   A surprising number don't know, but that is not so surprising when you come to think about it.   "Good morning.   How are you to-day?" all comes out in one continuous flow.   It is only when you start to write that you are obliged to separate the words from one another.   What is a proper sentence and what isn't is often a bugbear for much more advanced learners than Paul Bissex and his peers.</p>

<p>The third stage in the acquisition of spelling is called <strong>Phonetic. </strong>  Now Paul had given up writing letter-names for words and had achieved almost "total mapping of sound-symbol correspondence".   He had begun to leave spaces more reliably between words and to master the important skill of Segmentation (e.g. <i>Ste/phen</i> but <i>up/hill</i>).   What he heard dominated his writing and he had as yet no concept of the conventions of standard spelling which in English frequently conflict with what one hears.      I find that this is the stage at which most poor spellers have got stuck.   They are all the time engaged in a conscientious effort to listen to sounds and write them down in the order in which they hear them without ever consulting the contents of their visual memory, an absolutely essential - and highly trainable - tool for a good speller.   They are like "one-club" golfers and doomed to be equally unsuccessful.</p>


<p>Gentry called the fourth stage <strong>Transitional. </strong>  Paul found that concentrating on sound was not enough and began to introduce some spelling patterns derived from his visual memory - itself derived from his reading and from corrections to his writing offered by older and more experienced people.   A lot of his spellings are still non-standard and still over-reliant on phonics, but he is becoming more and more observant of standard spellings and more and more discriminating and successful in his decisions about when to use a phonic strategy and when his visual memory.</p>

<p>At the age of nine Paul had become a "Correct Speller".   Not all his writing by any means is correct, but this technical term means that he has achieved eight important accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.   His knowledge of the English Spelling System and its basic rules is firmly established.
<li>2.   He continually extends his knowledge of Word Environment Constraints.   This means he knows what combinations of letters are possible, where they can and can't fit into the word and how the stress in the spoken word affects its spelling.
<li>3.   He continually extends his knowledge of word structures, prefixes etc.   He distinguishes homophones (words which sound alike but have different meanings and, therefore, different spellings).
<li>4.   His accuracy with silent consonants and the doubling of consonants is always improving.
<li>5.   He can think of alternative ways to spell words and uses his visual memory to correct errors.
<li>6.   He is increasingly able to master alternatives (e.g. ei/ie) and irregularities.
<li>7.   He is increasingly able to master Latinate and other particular forms.
<li>8.   He is accumulating a large corpus of learned words.
</ul>
<p>There is no suggestion the spelling learner is conscious of knowing and doing all this, but s/he has somehow acquired the knowledge, the skill and the judgement to conjure up all of these when and as appropriate.    S/he certainly is not infallibly correct at this stage, but still makes mistakes and probably will do for ever (who, however learned and meticulous, does not find a few things to correct when they are reading what they have written?), but s/he can now go on alone, getting better and better, able to look up words efficiently when unsure and well on the way to achieving the automatic, accurate and predictable spelling which makes it possible for a writer to concentrate on the message or story without hesitating over the transcription of it.   Now, unless there is some illness or injury to the brain, there will be no question of going backwards.   And the number of words about which there is doubt will be few enough for there to be very little need of looking up in dictionaries.   Dictionaries are invaluable and everyone needs one from time to time but there is truth in the claim that if you can use a dictionary you don't need one and if you do need one you can't use it! </p>

<p>That is a description of learning to read and spell, but mostly concentrating on spelling which is so important and has been so neglected.   The length of the process will vary tremendously but, in a perfect world, the Correct Speller status would be reached by the time the child enters Secondary School.   By this time too reading will have been mastered, both of them well enough for the child to be able to continue through Secondary Education without being constantly hindered by literacy difficulties.</p>

<p>Reading and Writing are, of course, closely linked but, as we have seen, they are in themselves different processes.   If all goes well all this theory and analysis of the processes are not needed.   The child just seems to pick it up at astonishing speed and becoming more skilled and fluent by the day.   It is only when things go wrong that we need to understand what their brains are doing, though I think that is interesting in itself and a proper concern of at least some teachers.   I truly think that most children more or less teach themselves with very little help.   But big help is needed, and at once, when things start to go wrong.   Mari Clay, in her meticulous study of children beginning to read and write, found that 100 children managed to get into thirteen different kinds of trouble!    They were mostly tiny little muddles but they needed putting right at once, which was why she came up with the Reading Recovery Programme.</p>
