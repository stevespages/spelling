<h2>Writing Partners - A proposal</h2>




 
<h4>The Problem:</h4>

 

<p>Most educational failure starts with getting stuck on reading and writing, especially writing.    And the biggest difficulty in mastering writing is the inability to learn to spell.   This soon spills over into reading and later into all academic studies, so that sometines even promising starts begin to tail off.   This happens to about 15-20% of children in Britain.

 

   

<h4>The Wider Problem:</h4>

 

<p>If you cannot read and write, or if you just struggle with spelling, secondary school, where almost everything comes through the written word, becomes an ordeal.   The response, understandably, is often to play truant and we know that most school truants are poor readers and spellers.   Later on there is a strong correlation between school truancy and crime and the prisons are full of people who are intelligent but also illiterate.   It is not fanciful to suggest that better mastery of literacy in the early stages could contribut to a reduction in the frustration which leads many people into anti-social activities.   After all, what can you do to earn your living in our bureaucratic society if you can't read instructions or fill up a form?   Take to crime, of course!

 

 

<h4>The Solution:</h4>

 

<p>Effective help for children who are struggling with spelling and reading demands more time than teachers and schools can possibly provide.   On the other hand it does not demand qualifications and expertise.   It is not a teaching task, but ideal work for volunteers, working individually with the pupils under the supervision of the teachers.   We might call these people Writing Partners.

 

 

<h4>The Writing Partner's Task:</h4>

 

<p>Writing Partners would work with pupils individually.   The vital part of the task is to help the child to avoid making mistakes, over and over again, with very common words.   If they make the same mistake each time, an incorrect image of the word gets stuck into their memory.   If they write it in different ways at different times, a confused memory goes in;  this is almost worse, because even when they have written it correctly, they can't be sure which version is right.   The Writing Partner, then, goes through a child's writing soon after it is written and together they identify and correct any mistakes.   They then decide together which of these words the child needs to study and learn immediately and which can be noted and left till later.   They should follow the guidance for this part of the task given in First Things First:  Choosing the Words to Study [*** LINK ***] and the child should follow, meticulously (this is important), the drill Look, Cover, Write, Check, which is given in Learning Individual Words [*** LINK ***] 

 

<p>It is rather a dull, almost clerical, task, but it is what is needed.   The fun comes from getting to know the child, helping him/her to get over her/his difficulties and watching him/her getting better, perhaps beginning to enjoy writing rather than dreading and trying to avoid it.

 

<p>It is a task that needs to be done frequently but in small doses.   If you concentrate on a word for too long, even one you are quite sure of, it begins to look funny and you begin to lose confidence.  But there are other things to do in the time you spend together.   You need to talk about reading and writing, what they are for, how people use them, how much easier life is going to be for the child if he can read and write easily and accurately.   It seems surprising, but many children don't understand these things.   And you will learn more about the child's life and preoccupations interests and be able to help even more.   It will never be just the spelling.

 

<p>You also need to demonstrate to the child what a lot s/he has learned already and therefore what a lot s/he can continue to learn.    So a bit part of the job is talking and forming a kind of businesslike friendship, answering questions and bolstering confidence.   You will probably find yourself talking about why English spelling is so awful and will need to convince him/her (and very likely yourself!) that it isn't.  

 

<h4>Organisation:</h4>

 

<p>Writing Partners could work with children anywhere at any time, but it seems to me that the operation would fit in well with the After School Clubs which are now being encouraged.   Volunteers and pupils could meet their and intersperse their writing sessions with the other activities.   The school would need to provide a suitable person to organise the pairs, provide them with materials and be someone to whom they could turn for advice when necessary.   There should be meetings of volunteers with the organisers from time to time to discuss progress, raise questions and introduce topics related to the work.

 

 

<h4>Costs:</h4> 

 

<p>These would be minimal.   Each pair would need pens, pencils, paper, a rubber and a copy of The Alphabetical Spelling List (see First Things First), which costs less than £10.   The Organiser would need to be paid, say, 0.2% of a full-time salary, and, if the work was done when other activities were going on in the school, there would be no extra costs for the use of premises, heating etc.   A model might be the national Adult Literacy Scheme set up by the Government and the BBC in the 1970s, which many people found inspiring and rewarding in many different ways.
