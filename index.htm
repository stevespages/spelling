<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">LEARN TO SPELL</H2>

<P>This is a website about spelling, especially to help people who find it difficult and for people trying to help them.   There are people who want to write, or need to, and who know exactly what they want to say, but who have difficulty in writing it.   The biggest difficulty is usually with spelling.   Not being able to produce correct writing causes terrible frustration for huge numbers of people, schoolchildren, foremen, managers, students;  all these and many more have got to be able to write to do their work quickly and easily.   And there are a lot more people who just need to write occasionally, applying for jobs, filling in forms, writing to friends and family.   It is a shame if you are longing to write a tirade to the newspaper or to send a message to a friend and you can't get it down on paper.   Almost everybody can find the words and put them together all right, but far too many are frustrated or prevented altogether because they can't spell. 

<P>There are two sections.   If you just want to get started straight away on your own spelling problems or helping someone else, go to the <A HREF="helpnow/index.htm">Help Now</A> pages.   These tell you exactly what to do so that you can start at once.   They also have very short explanations for the advice I give.   So if you are interested in understanding more, you can go to the <A HREF="philosophical/index.htm">Philosophical Pages</A> and click on the different topics listed.
